# 🎯 Interactive Quiz Application Using Object-Oriented Programming

## 📌 Project Title
**Interactive Quiz Application Using Object-Oriented Programming**

---

## 💡 Motivation
The motivation behind developing this Quiz Application is to create a simple, interactive system that helps users test their knowledge in an easy and flexible way. Unlike fixed quiz programs, this project allows users to enter their own questions, which makes the application more customizable and practical for learning.

Through this project, I aimed to improve my understanding of **Java programming** and **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation. This quiz system enhances learning and builds confidence in writing structured, user-interactive programs.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Many existing quiz programs rely on predefined questions and lack customization. This creates a need for a flexible quiz system where users can create their own questions.

This project addresses the problem by developing a **Java-based quiz application** that allows users to:
- Enter multiple questions
- Provide four options per question
- Select the correct answer
- Attempt the quiz
- View the final score

The system accepts user input, checks answers, and displays results smoothly, solving the rigidity of traditional quiz systems.
